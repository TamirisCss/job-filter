- CSS3/ Flexbox
- Mobile friendly
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

```js methods

    includes()
    every()
```

### Useful resources

- [Array.prototype.splice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) - This helped me for removing a specific element of a array.
- [Array.prototype.includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) - This helped me in filtering element by checking if the elements has a certain value, returning true or false.
- [Array.prototype.every()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every) - This helped me in filtering element by checking if the elements has a certain value, returning true or false by a callbackFn.

### `npm start`
